##### Clean installer

You might want to reformat the drive first.  

Select: Fat32 format K: (Wipes Drive)  
Your letter dive may be different.  

>Why Fat32 and not NTFS?  
  
>Microsoft created NTFS and will not be able to use it for Linux operating systems. Plus, there’s really no reason to use NTFS on USB sticks and SD cards unless you really need support for files over 4GB in size.  
  
>Things to keep in mind are FAT32 only supports individual files up to 4GB in size and volumes up to 2TB in size. The file system corruption can happen much easier. FAT32 doesn’t support file permissions.
